AJAX Movie Recommendation System

Project Overview

The AJAX Movie Recommendation System is a web-based application that recommends movies based on user input. The system leverages AJAX for asynchronous data fetching and updates the web page dynamically without requiring a full page reload. Users can search for movies, view detailed information, and receive recommendations in real-time.

Features

Real-time movie search: Users can input movie names, and suggestions are provided dynamically using AJAX.
Movie recommendations: Based on the selected movie, the system suggests similar movies using a recommendation algorithm.
Movie details: The system fetches details like title, director, cast, genre, and plot summary.
Dynamic updates: The interface updates dynamically without page reload, improving user experience.
Responsive design: The application is responsive and works seamlessly across different devices.
